## 🧠 Project Motivation
This project started while building a client website. Instead of a static site, I wanted to create a **scalable system** that gave the client full control over their content. The goal was to:  
- Learn how to integrate **Supabase buckets & RLS policies** for media and content storage.  
- Explore **video compression pipelines** with FFmpeg.  
- Gain real-world experience in **DevOps, CI/CD pipelines, and cloud deployments**.

## 🏗️ How It Was Built
- **Frontend**: Next.js + Tailwind CSS for a responsive, dynamic admin dashboard.  
- **Backend**: Node.js + FFmpeg service for video compression.  
- **Database & Auth**: Supabase with RLS for granular security.  
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions for test → build → push → deploy automation.  
- **Cloud Deployment**:  
  - **AWS EC2** running Amazon Linux 2023.  
  - **Docker** for containerization.  
  - **Azure OIDC** for secure identity provider setup.

## 📚 What I Learned
- How to design a **CMS architecture** with real-time content editing.  
- Handling **large media files** efficiently with FFmpeg & Supabase.  
- Setting up **secure RLS policies** and JWT-based auth.  
- Automating deployment pipelines with **GitHub Actions + Docker + AWS**.  
- Managing cloud infrastructure with **Nginx + OIDC** integrations.
